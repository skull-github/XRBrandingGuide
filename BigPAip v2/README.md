This web app lets you input a Google Sheets URL and displays MLB team data, logos, spot colors, wordmarks, and live roster/player headshots in a table.

## Features
- Paste a public Google Sheets URL to load team data.
- Automatically saves and reloads the last used sheet URL.
- Auto-loads the sheet on app start if a URL is present.
- Displays columns for:
  - Team Logo Default â„¢
  - Logo Spot
  - Spot Color (with hex value)
  - Team Wordmark Logo - Light
  - Team Wordmark Logo - Dark
  - Roster (dropdown of active players)
  - Headshot Silo (shows headshot for selected player)
- All table cells are left-justified.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser to the local address shown in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5173).
4. Paste a public Google Sheets URL (must be shared as "Anyone with the link can view").
5. The app will remember and auto-load your last used URL on future visits.
6. Explore team logos, spot colors, wordmarks, and interact with live rosters and player headshots.

**Note:**
- The Google Sheet must have a column for Team ID (used for MLB API lookups).

   ```
2. Build the app:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
3. Start the Electron app:
